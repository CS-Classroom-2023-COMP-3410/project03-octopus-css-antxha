I started from the top to bottom and I did the easier parts first. The hardest bit for me was formatting the quiz section, aligning elements, and guessing the right color. I did not know how to align the octopus image to the right for a while. After searching it up, I decided to use the float property which was a perfect solution to my problem. After I got the picture to the right, it was smooth sailing from there. I assigned a few classes just to help me target specific elements in the html.
